# exhibit_code: an interactive code art experience
exhibit_code is a crossover between the art and computer science worlds that aims to explore the playful dynamic of human-machine influence. Visualizations
coded within Processing and P5.js are projected onto the walls of a room equipped with webcams, inviting the audience to approach each visual and interact
in different ways. Audience interactions are detected in real time by pre-trained neural networks that track hand movement and faces from RGB webcam feeds.
